                    <p><em>Code, Coffee, and Dreams</em></p>
                    <p>My days began before the sun. A cup of coffee in one hand, my laptop in the other, I settled into my favorite corner of the apartment. Before the world woke up, I was already deep in the logic of my latest coding challenge.  
                    I wasn’t a full-stack developer yet. But I was determined to be.  
                    By day, I worked a regular job, but every spare moment belonged to code. Tutorials, projects, debugging.</p>
                    <p>My life was a loop of learning and improving. JavaScript, Python, React, databases. Each piece of knowledge brought me closer to my dream.  
                    Some nights, I battled errors that refused to budge. Other nights, I celebrated small victories. My first interactive website, my first API integration, my first time fixing a bug without looking it up.  
                    Then came the moment I had been waiting for: an interview for my first real developer job.</p> 
                    <p>Heart pounding, I built a project from scratch in the coding test, explaining my logic with confidence.  
                    The email came two days later. ** “Welcome to the team.” **  
                    I stared at the screen, then laughed. Not because it was easy, but because I had proved to myself that I could do it.  
                    This was just the beginning.
